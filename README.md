# data-sync-engine

Creating a data synchronization engine between diverse systems in real-time is a complex project. Below is a simplified Python program to demonstrate the core concepts of such a system. This program uses in-memory data structures and threading to simulate the data synchronization process. In a real-world scenario, this would involve complex integrations with databases, message brokers, APIs, etc.

```python
import threading
import time
import random

# Mock databases
source_data = {'id1': 'data1', 'id2': 'data2'}
destination_data = {}

# Lock for thread safety
lock = threading.Lock()

def fetch_data_from_source():
    """Simulate fetching data from the source system."""
    with lock:
        # Simulate a new data entry in the source system
        new_id = f'id{len(source_data) + 1}'
        new_data = f'data{len(source_data) + 1}'
        source_data[new_id] = new_data
        print(f"Fetched new data from source: {new_id} -> {new_data}")

def sync_data():
    """Synchronize data from source to destination."""
    with lock:
        for data_id, data_value in source_data.items():
            if data_id not in destination_data:
                # Simulate data sync
                destination_data[data_id] = data_value
                print(f"Synchronized {data_id}: {data_value}")

def monitor_and_sync():
    """Monitor the source and continuously sync data."""
    while True:
        try:
            fetch_data_from_source()
            sync_data()
            # Sleep for a random interval to simulate real-time varying load
            time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during synchronization: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Launch synchronization in a separate thread
        sync_thread = threading.Thread(target=monitor_and_sync)
        sync_thread.start()

        # Let it run for a designated period for demonstration purposes
        time.sleep(10)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Synchronization interrupted by user.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        # Ensure the thread is properly shutdown
        sync_thread.join()
        print("Final data in destination:")
        print(destination_data)
```

### Explanation

- **Mock Databases**: We've created simple Python dictionaries to simulate source and destination systems.
- **Threading and Lock**: We use `threading.Thread` and `threading.Lock` to safely handle shared data in a multithreaded environment, ensuring data consistency.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling captures exceptions in the synchronization process and prints error messages.
- **Synchronization Process**: The `monitor_and_sync` function fetches new data from the source, checks if it already exists in the destination, and synchronizes it if not present.
- **Termination**: The program runs for a fixed time period for demo purposes and it's capable of handling interruptions gracefully.

This is a baseline implementation and should be extended with actual system integrations, robust error handling, logging mechanisms, configuration management, and scalability considerations for a production environment.
